# Design-circuit-with-6-servo-motors
This repository for the first task in Electronic Engineering track.

2- Design and program the electronic circuit contains 6 servo motors on simulation editor "Tinkercad".

-> Tools we need:

1- Arduino Uno R3.

2- Breadboard.

3- 6 Micro Servo Motors.

-> Steps:

Connect the breadboard with 5V and GROUND of the Arduino to make pin connection of 6 servo motors easier.

Each servo motor has 3 pins. Signal, Power and Ground. So we connect the Power and the Ground of each servo motor to the breadboard.

Signal pins connected to the Arduino as follow:

Servo 1 --> pin 3.

Servo 2 --> pin 5.

Servo 3 --> pin 6.

Servo 4 --> pin 9.

Servo 5 --> pin 10.

Servo 6 --> pin 13.

-> The Circuit:
